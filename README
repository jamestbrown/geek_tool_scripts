Just a few little geek tool scripts that are on my desktop right now


pnetstat.sh - a program that will print your Wireless Access Point, Ethernet IP, WiFi IP, and External IP

get_weather.py - a program that will use your IP to find the city and get weather information about it

To implement these, use the Shell Geeklet, and use the shell command to run both of these:

./<path>/pnetstat.sh

and 

python get_weather.py
